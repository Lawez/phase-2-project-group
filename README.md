## Project Overview

For this project, you will use multiple linear regression modeling to analyze house sales in a northwestern county.

### Business Problem

The business problem for this project is to provide guidance to homeowners on how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and by what amount. 

### The Data

This project uses the King County House Sales dataset, which can be found in  `kc_house_data.csv` in the data folder in this assignment's GitHub repository. The description of the column names can be found in `column_names.md` in the same folder. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described, so you'll have to do some research or use your best judgment if you have questions about what the data means.
